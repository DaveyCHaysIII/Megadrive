The goal of this library is to create a set of generic functions that will work with a whole suite of games.

Sample functions/functionalities to build:

1. A small and simple timer API
2. A one-and-done text crawl function (pass it a rect, a speed and a char array, possibly a color or a whole format struct to keep it lightweight?)
3. A pathfinding function (at least some functions to help with this, might be implementation specific)

Sample tools I'd like to make:
1. A map-making engine using autotiles (functionalitites both to draw and to set boundaries)
2. A simple animation tester
3. A test environment (game with simple assets to test out shaders, etc)

Sample problems I want to solve:
1. A simplified way of making generic character sprites (rigid rules for art style so I can make hundreds of people off a simple template)
2. Do convincing and efficient (no/limited overdraw) background paralax
3. Shader testbed (same as above test environment, but with actual shader stuff added, a good environment to actually learn shaders)
4.
