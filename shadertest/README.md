This was mostly auto generated by AI to give me a place to play with/figure out shaders and how they work.

Things I intend to use this for:

1. step-based fadeouts/ins for that retro hand-made sprite feel from the NES and younger days
2. start getting experimental - water effects, sine wave wobbly goodness
