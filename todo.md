	Make a Renderer class to encapsulate all the Begin() and End() modes, including begintransition() and endtransition()
	Make a Transition class to encapsulate all the data to do with transitions, with idle states so they only go into effect when triggered
	Make classes for splash, game, and their h files
	Finish out ctx class for context, paying close attention to init()
	Finish out ctx.Update(dt), to include updating the lilgreen sprite random animations
